Southeast Asian countries have diverse data privacy laws, generally requiring consent for data processing, granting data subject rights, and imposing penalties for non-compliance. Key legislations include Indonesia's PDP Law, Malaysia's PDPA, Thailand's PDPA, Vietnam's PDPD, Singapore's PDPA, and the Philippines' DPA. Many laws have extraterritorial reach, applying to businesses targeting their citizens from abroad. Data localization requirements vary, with some countries like Vietnam having stricter mandates, while others like Singapore are more open to cross-border data flows with safeguards. It is crucial for your company to understand the specific regulations in each target market.

# Navigating Data Privacy Laws in Southeast Asia: A Country-by-Country Guide for Chinese Robotic Companies

## 1. Overview of Data Protection Landscape in Southeast Asia

### 1.1. General Trends and Key Considerations for Foreign Investors

The data protection landscape in Southeast Asia has undergone significant evolution, particularly in the last decade, transitioning from a region with few comprehensive data protection laws prior to 2010 to one where most nations have established or are in the process of establishing robust frameworks . This shift is driven by the rapid growth of the digital economy, increasing cross-border trade, e-commerce, and digital services, compelling governments to secure personal data, protect user privacy, and enhance consumer trust . For foreign investors, especially Chinese robotic companies, this evolving landscape necessitates a careful and informed approach to compliance. A key trend is the increasing stringency of data protection laws, often drawing inspiration from comprehensive regulations like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), leading to a greater emphasis on data subject rights, stricter consent requirements, and more severe penalties for non-compliance . This underscores a regional commitment to securing personal data, which is crucial for fostering a sustainable digital ecosystem.



A critical consideration for foreign investors is the **diversity in approaches and the desire of each jurisdiction to address local considerations**, leading to significant differences among the various data protection laws in Southeast Asia, despite some similarities . While many laws incorporate common requirements such as limits on the processing of personal data (e.g., purpose specification, notification, and legal bases for processing) and care of personal data (e.g., security, retention, and accuracy), the specifics can vary considerably . This means that a **one-size-fits-all compliance strategy is unlikely to be effective**. Companies must develop tailored approaches for each country they operate in or target. Furthermore, the legal frameworks are not static; data protection laws in the region are continually developing. For instance, Singapore amended its law in 2021/2022 to introduce new provisions and increase penalties, while Malaysia and the Philippines have consulted on proposed amendments to their respective laws . This dynamic nature requires businesses to maintain ongoing vigilance and adapt their compliance programs as regulations evolve. The increasing focus on data protection also means that foreign companies, including those in the robotics sector, will face greater scrutiny regarding their data management practices, especially when handling sensitive data or engaging in cross-border data transfers .



### 1.2. Importance of Understanding Local Regulations for Market Entry

For a Chinese robotic company planning to expand into Southeast Asian countries, a **thorough understanding of local data and privacy regulations is paramount** for successful market entry and sustained operations. The regulatory landscape is characterized by a patchwork of national laws, each with its own nuances regarding data localization, consent requirements, penalties for non-compliance, and the extraterritorial application of these laws , . Failure to comply can result in **significant financial penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions**. For example, Indonesia's new Personal Data Protection (PDP) Law, which came into full effect in October 2024, represents a major shift, imposing stricter controls on businesses and holding both data controllers and processors equally liable for data breaches . Similarly, Vietnam's Decree on Personal Data Protection (Decree No.13/2023/ND-CP), effective from July 1, 2023, mandates data localization for personal data of Vietnamese citizens and requires explicit consent for data processing , . These examples underscore the need for proactive compliance measures.



The **extraterritorial reach of some of these laws is a critical factor**. Indonesia's PDP Law, for instance, applies to any entity processing personal data within Indonesia’s jurisdiction, as well as those outside the country that have legal implications within Indonesia or involve Indonesian citizens abroad . Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) also applies to data processing activities of foreign entities concerning data subjects in Thailand, regardless of where the organization is based , . This means that even if a Chinese robotic company operates primarily from China but targets customers or monitors the behavior of individuals in these Southeast Asian countries, it could still be subject to local data privacy laws. Therefore, before launching any products or services, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the data protection obligations in each target market. This includes understanding the definitions of personal data and sensitive personal data, the legal bases for processing, data subject rights, data breach notification requirements, and any specific sectoral regulations that might apply to robotics or related technologies. Developing a robust compliance framework that addresses these local requirements will not only mitigate legal risks but also build trust with customers and partners in the region .



## 2. Country-Specific Data Privacy Laws and Regulations

### 2.1. Indonesia

Indonesia's primary data protection framework is established by **Law No. 27 of 2022 on Personal Data Protection (PDP Law)**, enacted on October 17, 2022, and fully effective from October 17, 2024 , . This comprehensive legislation marks a significant advancement, consolidating previously fragmented regulations into a unified framework and aligning Indonesia's data protection standards more closely with international benchmarks like the GDPR , . Prior to the PDP Law, personal data protection was governed by a patchwork of over 30 different laws and regulations, including Article 28G(1) of the 1945 Indonesian Constitution, Law No. 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions (EIT Law), Government Regulation No. 71 of 2019 on the Implementation of Electronic Systems and Transactions (GR 71), and Ministry of Communication and Informatics Regulation No. 20 of 2016 concerning Protection of Personal Data in Electronic Systems (MoCI Reg 20/2016) . The PDP Law aims to bolster trust in the digital economy and is overseen by the newly established Indonesian Data Protection Authority . A draft Government Regulation (Draft GR PDP) is anticipated to provide further implementing details .



The Indonesian PDP Law has a **broad scope and significant extraterritorial reach**. It applies to any person, public body, or international organization that conducts data processing activities, whether electronically or non-electronically, that have a legal impact in Indonesia or affect Indonesian data subjects residing in Indonesia , . This means that foreign entities outside of Indonesia, including Chinese robotic companies, will be subject to the PDP Law if they process personal data of Indonesian citizens and their activities fall within the scope defined by the law . The law applies to both data controllers and data processors. The PDP Law defines a data controller as any person, public body, or international organization acting individually or jointly in determining the purposes and exercising control over the processing of personal data. A data processor is defined as any person, public body, or international organization acting individually or jointly in processing personal data on behalf of the data controller. This broad applicability ensures that entities processing Indonesian data, regardless of their location, must adhere to the standards set forth in the PDP Law. The law defines personal data as information about an identified or identifiable individual, either directly or indirectly, through electronic or non-electronic means , and categorizes it into "General Personal Data" (e.g., full name, gender, citizenship) and "Specific Personal Data" (e.g., health information, biometric data, genetic data, criminal records, child data, personal financial data) .



The Indonesian PDP Law establishes several core data protection principles, including **lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; security; and accountability** , . Data controllers are obligated to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully and fairly, and that data subjects are informed about how their data is being used. Data subjects under the PDP Law are granted a comprehensive suite of rights, empowering them to have greater control over their personal information . These rights include:

* **Right to be Informed:** Awareness of who is processing their data and for what purpose , .

* **Right to Access:** Obtain access to their personal data and supplementary information , .

* **Right to Rectification:&#x20;**&#x41;bility to correct inaccuracies in their data , .

* **Right to Erasure and Restriction of Processing:** Terminate the processing or request deletion of their data under certain conditions , .

* **Right Concerning Automated Decision-Making and Profiling:** Object to decisions made solely on automated processing , .

* **Right to Object:&#x20;**&#x4F;ppose the processing of their data in certain circumstances , .

* **Right to Claim Compensation:** Seek redress for damages resulting from data misuse , .

* **Right to Data Portability:&#x20;**&#x54;ransfer their data across different services , .

These rights empower individuals and place significant obligations on data controllers and processors to implement mechanisms for individuals to exercise these rights effectively.



**Consent is a key legal basis for processing personal data** under Indonesia's PDP Law , . The law requires that consent be obtained **clearly and in an informed manner**. For consent to be valid, it must be given explicitly, voluntarily, and in an informed manner. Data controllers are required to clearly inform data subjects about the purposes of data collection and processing, the types of data being collected, the period of storage, and their rights, including the right to withdraw consent . The Draft GR PDP further clarifies that **consent for minors (defined as anyone under 18 and unmarried) must be obtained from their parents or legal guardians**, with no explicit exceptions for services like financial services, healthcare, or AI software for education and entertainment . Service providers must ensure that parental or guardian consent is obtained and verify the identity of the person authorizing the service. The PDP Law also acknowledges other legal bases for processing, similar to the GDPR, such as contractual necessity, compliance with a data controller’s legal obligations, protection of the vital interests of the data subject, public interest, and legitimate interests .



Indonesia's approach to data localization is nuanced. While the PDP Law does not impose a general data localization mandate for all private sector data, it does require that **critical personal data, as defined by the government, must be stored locally** . Sector-specific localization requirements also remain, particularly in finance, where Bank Indonesia and the Financial Services Authority (OJK) have imposed mandates . Government Regulation No. 71 of 2019 (GR 71) also requires public electronic system operators (ESOs) to process and store their data within Indonesia , . Private ESOs, while given more flexibility, are expected to maintain the effectiveness of legal enforcement and monitoring in Indonesia .



Regarding cross-border data transfers, the PDP Law permits such transfers under certain conditions. The primary requirement is that the **receiving country must have an adequate level of data protection**, comparable to that provided under the PDP Law , . If the receiving country does not offer an adequate level of protection, the transfer can still occur if the data subject has given their **explicit consent** to the transfer, or if other safeguards are in place, such as binding corporate rules (BCRs) or standard contractual clauses (SCCs) that ensure the protection of the personal data , . GR71 also imposes specific administrative hurdles for cross-border data transfers, requiring companies to obtain explicit written consent from data subjects in Bahasa Indonesia, report transfer plans to MCIT, and coordinate all transfers with the ministry . The PDP Law also introduces concepts like prior and post-notifications to the regulator for cross-border personal data transfers .



The Indonesian PDP Law establishes a **tiered system of penalties for non-compliance**, encompassing administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions , . **Administrative sanctions** can include written warnings, temporary suspension of data processing activities, deletion or destruction of personal data, and administrative fines. The administrative fines can be substantial, potentially reaching up to **2% of the company's annual revenue** , . **Criminal penalties** are also severe. For instance, unlawfully obtaining or collecting personal data can lead to a fine of up to IDR 5 billion (approximately USD 320,000) and/or a maximum prison sentence of 5 years . Unlawfully disclosing personal data without consent or intentionally using unlawfully obtained personal data can result in a fine of up to IDR 4 billion (approximately USD 255,000) and/or a maximum prison sentence of 4 years , . Falsifying personal data with the intent to benefit oneself or harm others can attract a fine of up to IDR 6 billion (approximately USD 380,000) and/or a maximum prison sentence of 6 years , . Corporations may face even harsher penalties, including fines up to ten times higher and additional consequences such as dissolution or revocation of business licenses . The law also provides for **civil liability**, allowing data subjects to claim compensation for damages suffered due to violations of their personal data rights .



### 2.2. Malaysia

The primary data protection law in Malaysia is the **Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) (Act 709)**, which came into effect in 2013 , . This Act governs the processing of personal data in commercial transactions and aims to protect individuals' personal data from misuse by organizations. Significant amendments to the PDPA were introduced through the **Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2024**, which received Royal Assent on October 9, 2024, and is being implemented in phases throughout 2025 , . These amendments aim to align Malaysia's data protection framework more closely with international standards, such as the GDPR, and introduce several key changes, including the replacement of the term "data user" with "data controller," **mandatory data breach notifications**, mandatory appointment of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) in certain circumstances, classification of biometric data as sensitive personal data, introduction of data portability rights, and revised rules for cross-border data transfers , . The Personal Data Protection Commissioner (PDPC) and the Personal Data Protection Department (PDPD) are responsible for enforcement , .



The Malaysian PDPA 2010 applies to any person who processes, or has control over or authorizes the processing of, any personal data in respect of **commercial transactions** , . The term "commercial transactions" is broadly defined. The Act applies to data users (now data controllers) established in Malaysia and also to data users outside Malaysia if they use equipment in Malaysia for processing personal data, other than for transit purposes , . This implies a degree of extraterritorial applicability. The 2024 amendments further clarify and reinforce the obligations of data processors, making them directly liable for certain breaches . The PDPA distinguishes between "personal data" (any information relating directly or indirectly to an identifiable data subject) and "sensitive personal data" (e.g., health, political opinions, religious beliefs, biometric data), with stricter rules for the latter , .



The Malaysian PDPA is built upon seven Personal Data Protection Principles that data controllers must comply with :

1. **General Principle**: Personal data shall not be processed unless the data subject has given consent, except in specific circumstances.

2. **Notice and Choice Principle**: Data controllers must inform data subjects about their data processing activities and the purposes for which their data is being processed.

3. **Disclosure Principle**: Personal data shall not be disclosed without the consent of the data subject, except in specific circumstances.

4. **Security Principle**: Data controllers must take practical steps to protect personal data from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access.

5. **Retention Principle**: Personal data shall not be kept longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which it was collected.

6. **Data Integrity Principle**: Data controllers must ensure that personal data is accurate, complete, not misleading, and kept up-to-date.

7. **Access Principle**: Data subjects have the right to access their personal data and correct it if it is inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, or misleading.

The 2024 amendments enhance these principles and introduce new obligations, such as the **right to data portability** , . Data subjects also have the right to withdraw consent to the processing of their personal data .



**Consent is a fundamental requirement** under the Malaysian PDPA for the processing of personal data , . Data controllers must obtain the data subject's consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their personal data, unless an exemption applies. The Act requires that **consent be explicit for the processing of sensitive personal data** , . For general personal data, documented consent is required, which necessitates a clear indication of agreement from the data subject , . Data controllers are obligated to inform data subjects, in both English and Malay, about the purposes of data collection, how their data will be used, and their rights under the PDPA . This "Notice and Choice Principle" is crucial for ensuring that consent is informed. The 2024 amendments expand the definition of "sensitive personal data" to include "biometric data" , .



The Malaysian PDPA **does not contain explicit, broad data localization requirements** mandating that all personal data must be stored within Malaysia's borders , . However, it does regulate the transfer of personal data outside of Malaysia. The 2024 amendments have significantly revised these rules, abolishing the previous "whitelist" regime . The amended PDPA allows for the transfer of personal data to a place outside Malaysia if:

1. There is in force in that place any law which is substantially similar to the PDPA, or

2. That place ensures an adequate level of protection in relation to the processing of personal data which is at least equivalent to the level of protection afforded by the PDPA .

To operationalize these provisions, the PDPC issued the **Guidelines on Cross-Border Personal Data Transfer** in April/May 2025, stipulating that data controllers must conduct a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) . If the TIA indicates that the recipient country does not meet the conditions, data controllers can still transfer data if an exception under Section 129(3) of the PDPA applies, such as data subject consent, contractual necessity, or if the controller has exercised due diligence through measures like BCRs or SCCs .



The Malaysian PDPA provides for **significant penalties for non-compliance**, which have been increased under the 2024 amendments. Previously, breaches of the PDP Principles could result in fines up to MYR 300,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 2 years . The 2024 amendments have increased these penalties for data controllers breaching the PDP Principles to a fine of up to **MYR 1 million** and/or a term of imprisonment of up to **3 years**, effective April 1, 2025 , . Data processors who breach the Security Principle can also face a fine of up to MYR 1 million and/or imprisonment for up to 3 years . For failure to comply with mandatory data breach notification requirements, the penalty can be a fine of up to **MYR 250,000** and/or imprisonment for up to **2 years** , . The PDPC is responsible for enforcing the Act and can issue enforcement notices, conduct audits, and prosecute offenders . The Act also provides data subjects with a right of private action to seek compensation for damages suffered due to a contravention of the Act .



### 2.3. Thailand

The primary data protection law in Thailand is the **Personal Data Protection Act B.E. 2562 (2019) (PDPA)** , . Enacted in 2019 and fully implemented on June 1, 2022, the PDPA established a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal data, aligning Thailand's data protection standards with international norms like the GDPR . The PDPA regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and grants rights to data subjects. It applies to both physical and digital records and covers businesses operating within Thailand as well as those outside Thailand that offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in Thailand , . The law is overseen by the Personal Data Protection Committee (PDPC), which has issued various sub-regulations and guidelines to clarify compliance requirements .



Thailand's PDPA has a **broad scope of application**. It applies to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal data by a data controller or a data processor operating within Thailand, regardless of whether the processing takes place in Thailand or not , . Crucially, the PDPA also has **extraterritorial effect**. It applies to data processing activities of foreign entities that offer goods or services to data subjects in Thailand, irrespective of whether payment is required, or that monitor the behavior of data subjects in Thailand , . This means that a Chinese robotic company targeting Thai customers or analyzing the behavior of individuals in Thailand would likely fall under the jurisdiction of the PDPA. The law defines personal data as any information relating to a person which enables the identification of that person, whether directly or indirectly. It also distinguishes between general personal data and sensitive personal data (e.g., health, biometric, racial information), with stricter rules for the latter .



The PDPA is built upon core data protection principles, including **lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; security; and accountability**. Data subjects are granted several rights under the PDPA, empowering them to have more control over their personal data. These rights include:

* **Right to be Informed**: Data subjects must be informed about the collection, use, and disclosure of their personal data.

* **Right to Access**: Data subjects can request access to and obtain a copy of their personal data.

* **Right to Rectification**: Data subjects can request the correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.

* **Right to Data Portability**: In certain circumstances, data subjects can request their personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format.

* **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: Data subjects can request the deletion or destruction of their personal data under specific conditions.

* **Right to Restrict Processing**: Data subjects can request the restriction of processing of their personal data in certain situations.

* **Right to Object**: Data subjects can object to the processing of their personal data for certain purposes, such as direct marketing.

* **Right not to be Subject to Automated Decision-Making**: Data subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, if it produces legal effects or significantly affects them.

Robotic companies must establish procedures to facilitate the exercise of these rights by data subjects in Thailand.



**Consent is a primary legal basis for processing personal data** under the Thai PDPA, particularly for sensitive personal data, where **explicit consent is mandatory** , . For general personal data, consent is also generally required, unless another lawful basis applies (e.g., contract performance, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, or legitimate interests). The PDPA defines "consent" as any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of their personal data. Data controllers must be able to demonstrate that consent has been obtained. When collecting personal data, companies must clearly inform data subjects of the purposes of collection, the types of personal data collected, the period for which the data will be retained, and the rights of the data subjects . For the data of **minors (under 20 years of age, unless emancipated), parental consent is required** .



Thailand's PDPA **does not impose general data localization requirements** mandating that all personal data must be stored within Thailand. However, it does regulate cross-border transfers of personal data. A data controller may transfer personal data to another country or an international organization only if that destination country or international organization has **adequate data protection standards**, as determined by the Personal Data Protection Committee (PDPC) . If the destination does not have adequate standards, the data controller can still transfer data if they can ensure **appropriate safeguards** are in place to protect the personal data, such as legally binding and enforceable instruments between the data exporter and importer, or binding corporate rules. In the absence of adequacy or appropriate safeguards, transfers may still be permissible under specific derogations, such as with the explicit consent of the data subject, or if necessary for the performance of a contract. The PDPC has issued detailed sub-regulations on cross-border data transfers to clarify these requirements .



Violations of Thailand's PDPA can result in **significant penalties**. Administrative fines for non-compliance can be up to **5 million Baht** (approximately US$146,820) . Criminal penalties can include imprisonment for up to one year, or fines ranging from 500,000 Baht to 1 million Baht, or both, depending on the nature and severity of the offense . Data controllers may also be liable for **punitive damages and compensation** for any damages incurred by data subjects as a result of unlawful data processing activities , . The PDPC has been actively ramping up audits and inspections, prompting businesses to strengthen their data protection practices to avoid these penalties . The appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) is mandatory in certain circumstances, particularly when processing sensitive data, and failure to appoint one can also lead to non-compliance risks .



### 2.4. Vietnam



Vietnam's primary data protection framework is established by the **Law on Cybersecurity No. 24/2018/QH14**, which took effect on June 12, 2018, and was further clarified by **Decree No. 53/2022/ND-CP** detailing its implementation , . More recently, **Decree No. 13/2023/ND-CP on Personal Data Protection (PDPD)**, enacted on April 17, 2023, and effective from July 1, 2023, serves as the main regulation governing personal data protection , . This decree provides detailed rules on the processing of personal data, rights of data subjects, and responsibilities of organizations and individuals involved in data processing. Vietnam is also in the process of enacting a comprehensive **Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL)**, which is expected to supersede or supplement the existing decree, with key provisions anticipated to take effect in 2026 , . The PDPD is considered one of the most stringent data protection regulations in the region, heavily influenced by the GDPR.



Vietnam's PDPD has a **broad scope and extraterritorial reach**. It applies to:

1. Vietnamese agencies, organizations, and individuals.

2. Foreign agencies, organizations, and individuals processing personal data in Vietnam.

3. Vietnamese agencies, organizations, and individuals processing personal data outside Vietnam.

4. Foreign agencies, organizations, and individuals processing personal data of Vietnamese data subjects, even if the processing occurs outside Vietnam , .

This means that Chinese robotic companies targeting Vietnamese data subjects are likely subject to the PDPD, regardless of their physical presence in Vietnam. The decree covers both online and offline processing of personal data. It defines personal data broadly as information in the form of symbols, letters, numbers, images, sounds, or the like on an electronic medium that identifies a specific individual or helps to identify a specific individual . The law also distinguishes between basic personal data and sensitive personal data, with stricter requirements for the latter.



The Vietnamese PDPD establishes several core principles for personal data processing, including **lawfulness, fairness, transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; security; and accountability** . Data controllers and processors are required to ensure that personal data is processed in accordance with the law, for specified and legitimate purposes, and that data subjects are informed about the processing activities. Data subjects under the PDPD are granted a comprehensive set of rights, including:

* **Right to Know**: To be informed about the processing of their personal data.

* **Right to Consent**: To give or withhold consent for processing, unless an exception applies.

* **Right to Access**: To access their personal data.

* **Right to Withdraw Consent**: To withdraw their consent at any time.

* **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: To request the deletion of their personal data.

* **Right to Restrict Data Processing**: To request the restriction of processing in certain circumstances.

* **Right to Data Portability**: To receive their data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller.

* **Right to Object**: To object to the processing of their personal data for certain purposes.

* **Right to Complain, Denounce, and Claim Damages**: To lodge complaints and seek redress for violations.

* **Right to Self-Protection**: To take measures to protect their personal data.

Organizations must establish mechanisms to facilitate the exercise of these rights.



**Consent is a primary legal basis for processing personal data** under the Vietnamese PDPD . The decree requires that consent must be **freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous**. Data subjects must be clearly informed about the purposes of collection, the types of data, the entities to whom data may be disclosed, and their rights before consent is obtained. For sensitive personal data, **explicit consent is generally required**. The PDPD also specifies situations where consent is not required, such as for the protection of life and health of data subjects or others, for public interest activities, or for compliance with legal obligations. However, these exceptions are interpreted narrowly. Data controllers must be able to demonstrate that valid consent has been obtained and must provide easy mechanisms for data subjects to withdraw consent. The processing of personal data of **minors under 16 years of age requires the consent of their parent or legal guardian**, unless otherwise provided by law.



Vietnam has **significant data localization requirements**. The Law on Cybersecurity mandates that domestic and foreign enterprises providing telecommunications services, internet services, and value-added services in cyberspace in Vietnam that collect, analyze, and process personal data, data on relationships of service users, or data generated by service users in Vietnam must **store this data in Vietnam for a specified period** (at least 24 months for metadata and 12 months for content data) . Furthermore, these enterprises must establish a local branch or representative office in Vietnam. The PDPD further regulates cross-border transfers of personal data. Such transfers are permitted only if certain conditions are met, including:

1. The data subject has given **explicit consent** to the transfer.

2. The transfer is for the **performance of a contract** to which the data subject is a party.

3. The transfer is necessary for **implementing measures at the request of the data subject**.

4. The transfer is necessary for the **protection of the life, health, or other vital interests of the data subject**.

5. The transfer is necessary for **national security or defense purposes**.

6. The transfer is necessary for **fulfilling obligations under international treaties to which Vietnam is a signatory**.

7. The transfer is necessary for **protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the data controller or processor**.

Before transferring personal data abroad, data controllers/processors must conduct an assessment of the impact of the data processing and submit it to the Department of Cybersecurity and High-Tech Crime Prevention (A05) under the Ministry of Public Security for approval. They must also ensure that the recipient country or international organization has an adequate level of data protection or that appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., contractual clauses, BCRs).



The Vietnamese PDPD outlines a range of **penalties for non-compliance**, including warnings, monetary fines, suspension of operations, and revocation of licenses. The specific fines can be substantial, although the exact amounts are often determined by separate regulations on administrative sanctions. For example, violations related to the processing of personal data without consent or for purposes other than those stated can attract significant fines. The Law on Cybersecurity also provides for penalties for non-compliance with data localization and local office requirements, which can include fines and restrictions on operations in Vietnam. In addition to administrative penalties, individuals responsible for serious violations may also face criminal liability under the Penal Code. The enforcement of these penalties is carried out by various authorities, including the Ministry of Public Security, which plays a key role in overseeing data protection compliance. The stringent nature of the PDPD and its enforcement mechanisms highlight the importance of robust compliance programs for any company operating in or targeting Vietnam.



### 2.5. Philippines

The primary data protection law in the Philippines is the **Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173)**, commonly referred to as the DPA . This Act established a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal data in both the government and private sectors. The DPA is enforced by the **National Privacy Commission (NPC)**, which is an independent body mandated to administer and implement the provisions of the DPA and to monitor and ensure compliance of the country with international standards for data protection . The NPC has issued various implementing rules and regulations (IRRs), circulars, and advisories to provide guidance on specific aspects of the DPA. The Philippines was one of the early adopters of comprehensive data protection legislation in Southeast Asia, and its DPA is largely modeled after international data protection principles, including those found in the GDPR and APEC Privacy Framework.



The Philippine DPA applies to the **processing of all types of personal information** and to any natural or juridical person involved in personal information processing, including those who control the collection, holding, processing, or use of personal information (data controllers) and those who process personal information on behalf of a personal information controller (data processors) . The DPA has **extraterritorial application** in certain circumstances. It applies to an act done or practice engaged in and outside of the Philippines by an entity if:

1. The act, practice, or processing relates to personal information about a Philippine citizen or resident.

2. The entity has a link with the Philippines, and the entity is processing personal information in the Philippines or even if the processing is outside the Philippines as long as it is about Philippine citizens or residents. A "link with the Philippines" can include the entity having an office, branch, or agency in the Philippines, or if it carries on business in the Philippines.

3. The entity has other links in the Philippines as prescribed by the NPC.

This means that foreign companies, including Chinese robotic firms, that process personal data of Filipino citizens or residents and have a connection to the Philippines can be subject to the DPA.



The Philippine DPA is built upon internationally recognized data privacy principles, including:

* **Transparency**: Data subjects must be aware of the nature, purpose, and extent of the processing of their personal data.

* **Legitimate Purpose**: Personal data shall be processed for a declared, specified, and legitimate purpose.

* **Proportionality**: Personal data processed shall be adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and processed.

* **Data Quality**: Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.

* **Security**: Personal data shall be protected using appropriate organizational, physical, and technical security measures.

* **Retention Limitation**: Personal data shall be retained only for as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which the data was obtained or as required by law.

* **Accountability**: Personal information controllers are accountable for and shall demonstrate compliance with the DPA.

Data subjects are granted several rights under the DPA, including the **right to be informed, right to access, right to object, right to erasure or blocking, right to damages, right to rectify, right to data portability, and right to file a complaint** with the NPC .



**Consent is a key lawful basis for processing personal data** under the Philippine DPA. For consent to be valid, it must be **freely given, specific, and an informed indication of will**, signifying agreement to the processing of personal data. Data subjects must be clearly informed about the identity of the personal information controller, the purposes of the processing, the types of personal data concerned, the scope and method of processing, the recipients of the personal data, and their rights as data subjects, including the right to withdraw consent. The DPA requires that consent be evidenced by written, electronic, or recorded means. For sensitive personal information (e.g., race, ethnic origin, marital status, health, education, genetic or sexual life, any proceeding for any offense committed or alleged to have been committed) and privileged information, **consent must be explicit**. The DPA also provides for other lawful bases for processing, such as contractual necessity, compliance with a legal obligation, protection of vital interests, public interest, and legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided these are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.



The Philippines **does not impose general data localization requirements** mandating that all personal data must be stored within its borders. However, the DPA regulates the cross-border transfer of personal information. A personal information controller may transfer personal data to a third country or international organization only if it ensures that the recipient country or international organization provides a **comparable level of protection** to that afforded under the DPA. The NPC may issue a list of countries or international organizations that provide such adequate protection. In the absence of an adequacy finding, a personal information controller may still transfer personal data if it has provided appropriate safeguards, such as through contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or other legally binding instruments, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. The NPC has issued guidelines on cross-border data transfers, including the adoption of the **ASEAN Model Contractual Clauses (MCCs)** for data transfers within the region.



The Philippine DPA imposes **significant penalties for violations**, which can include both imprisonment and substantial fines. The penalties vary depending on the nature and severity of the offense. For instance:

* Unauthorized processing of personal information and sensitive personal information can result in imprisonment ranging from one year to six years and fines ranging from PHP 500,000 to PHP 4 million (approximately USD 8,500 to USD 68,000).

* Negligence in safeguarding personal information can lead to imprisonment from one year to three years and fines from PHP 500,000 to PHP 2 million (approximately USD 8,500 to USD 34,000).

* Unauthorized disclosure of personal information can result in imprisonment from one year and six months to five years and fines from PHP 500,000 to PHP 2 million.

* Malicious disclosure of sensitive personal information can lead to imprisonment from two years and six months to six years and fines from PHP 500,000 to PHP 4 million.

The NPC also has the authority to impose administrative fines and other sanctions, such as cease and desist orders, temporary or permanent bans on processing, and public apologies. The severity of the penalties underscores the importance of robust data protection compliance in the Philippines.



### 2.6. Singapore

The primary data protection law in Singapore is the **Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA)** , . The PDPA governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data by organizations in a manner that recognizes both the right of individuals to protect their personal data and the need of organizations to collect, use, or disclose personal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. The PDPA is administered and enforced by the **Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC)**. The Act has undergone several amendments, most notably in 2020 and 2021, to strengthen its provisions, enhance consumer trust, and support Singapore's digital economy. These amendments introduced, among other things, mandatory data breach notification requirements, an expanded scope for the deemed consent framework, and increased financial penalties for non-compliance . The PDPA is complemented by various advisory guidelines and best practice guides issued by the PDPC to help organizations understand and comply with their obligations.



The Singaporean PDPA applies to all private sector organizations, regardless of size or industry, that collect, use, or disclose personal data in Singapore, whether the organization is incorporated in Singapore or not . The Act also has **extraterritorial reach**. It applies to organizations outside Singapore that collect, use, or disclose personal data of individuals in Singapore if they have an "office or a place of business" in Singapore, or if they collect, use, or disclose the personal data while physically present in Singapore, unless the data was collected, used, or disclosed outside Singapore and is not intended to be further processed in Singapore . The PDPA generally does not apply to public agencies, which are governed by separate government data protection rules, or to individuals acting in a personal or domestic capacity. The definition of "personal data" under the PDPA is broad, covering any data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data, or from that data and other information to which the organization has or is likely to have access.



The Singaporean PDPA is built upon several key obligations for organizations, which include:

* **Consent Obligation**: Organizations must generally obtain consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal data.

* **Purpose Limitation Obligation**: Personal data may only be collected, used, or disclosed for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances and for which the individual has been informed.

* **Notification Obligation**: Organizations must inform individuals of the purposes for which their personal data is being collected, used, or disclosed.

* **Access and Correction Obligation**: Organizations must, upon request, provide individuals with access to their personal data and allow them to correct any errors or omissions.

* **Accuracy Obligation**: Organizations must make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal data collected is accurate and complete.

* **Protection Obligation**: Organizations must protect personal data in their possession or under their control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks.

* **Retention Limitation Obligation**: Organizations must cease to retain personal data as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which it was collected is no longer being served by such retention, and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.

* **Transfer Limitation Obligation**: Organizations must ensure that personal data transferred outside of Singapore is accorded a standard of protection comparable to that under the PDPA.

* **Openness Obligation**: Organizations must make information about their data protection policies, practices, and complaints process available on request.

* **Data Breach Notification Obligation**: Organizations must assess and notify the PDPC and affected individuals of data breaches that meet certain thresholds.

Data subjects in Singapore have rights, including the right to access their personal data, the right to request correction of their personal data, and the right to withdraw consent.



**Consent is a primary legal basis for collecting, using, or disclosing personal data** under the Singaporean PDPA. For consent to be valid, it must be **voluntary, informed, and unambiguous**. Organizations must inform individuals of the purposes for which their personal data will be collected, used, or disclosed, and obtain their consent before or at the time of collection. The PDPA also recognizes deemed consent in certain situations, such as when an individual voluntarily provides their personal data for a purpose, or when it is reasonably expected that personal data will be collected, used, or disclosed for that purpose. The 2020 amendments to the PDPA expanded the scope for deemed consent, including through contractual necessity and notification with an opt-out opportunity in specific circumstances. For sensitive personal data (e.g., NRIC numbers, passport numbers, financial information, health information), organizations are generally expected to obtain explicit consent. Individuals also have the right to withdraw their consent at any time by giving reasonable notice to the organization.



Singapore **does not impose general data localization requirements**. Organizations are generally free to store personal data outside of Singapore. However, the PDPA includes a **Transfer Limitation Obligation**. This obligation requires organizations to ensure that personal data transferred outside of Singapore is accorded a standard of protection that is **comparable to the protection afforded under the PDPA** . To meet this obligation, organizations can rely on various mechanisms, such as:

1. Entering into legally binding agreements (e.g., standard contractual clauses) with the receiving party that require them to provide a comparable standard of protection.

2. Ensuring that the recipient is bound by legally enforceable obligations (e.g., binding corporate rules) to provide a comparable standard of protection.

3. Transferring data to a jurisdiction that has been prescribed by the Singaporean government as having a comparable standard of data protection (a "whitelist" approach, though this list is not extensively populated).

4. Obtaining the explicit consent of the individual for the transfer, after informing them that the jurisdiction may not have comparable protection.

The PDPC has issued guidance on how organizations can meet this transfer limitation obligation, emphasizing the need for due diligence and appropriate safeguards.



The Singaporean PDPA provides for **significant penalties for non-compliance**. The PDPC has the power to issue directions to organizations to comply with the Act, stop collecting, using, or disclosing personal data in contravention of the Act, destroy personal data collected unlawfully, and pay a financial penalty. The financial penalties were significantly increased following the 2020 amendments. For contraventions of key data protection provisions, organizations can be fined up to **SGD 1 million** . For data breaches, the PDPC considers various factors in determining the penalty, including the nature and sensitivity of the data, the impact of the breach, the organization's efforts to mitigate the breach, and its track record of compliance. In addition to financial penalties, the PDPC can also name organizations found to be in breach of the PDPA, which can lead to reputational damage. Individuals who knowingly or recklessly disclose personal data in contravention of the PDPA can also face fines and imprisonment.



### 2.7. Brunei Darussalam

The primary data protection legislation in Brunei Darussalam is the **Personal Data Protection Order, 2025 (PDPO 2025)** , . This Order was officially published in the Government Gazette on January 8, 2025, and its approval was announced by the Minister of Transport and Infocommunications on March 6, 2025 , . The PDPO 2025 establishes a comprehensive data protection regime in Brunei, moving beyond previous sector-specific or limited privacy provisions. It aims to regulate the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data by organizations, thereby enhancing individual privacy rights and fostering a more secure digital environment . The Authority for Info-communications Technology Industry of Brunei Darussalam (AITI) is the responsible authority for administering and enforcing the PDPO . The development of the PDPO was spearheaded by AITI, which issued a public consultation paper on the draft order in May 2021 , . The PDPO 2025 is a key component of Brunei's digital transformation strategy, particularly its *Digital Economy Masterplan 2025* .



The Personal Data Protection Order (PDPO) 2025 of Brunei Darussalam primarily applies to **private sector organizations** and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) , . The Order governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data by these entities . According to the Public Consultation Paper released by AITI, the PDPO is intended to apply to all private sector organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal data *in* Brunei Darussalam, irrespective of whether they are formed or recognized under Bruneian law, or whether they are resident or have an office or place of business in the country . This formulation suggests a degree of **extraterritorial applicability**, meaning that organizations located overseas may still be subject to the PDPO if they engage in data processing activities involving personal data in Brunei Darussalam , . However, the US-ASEAN Business Council has recommended a more limited territorial scope, citing challenges in enforcing regulations on foreign organizations with no physical presence in Brunei , . The PDPO does not apply to individuals acting in a personal or domestic capacity, individuals acting as employees or officers of an organization, business contact information, or personal data of deceased persons . There is also a "Public Agency Exclusion," meaning government entities are not directly covered by the PDPO but are expected to adhere to other existing frameworks for data management , .



The Personal Data Protection Order (PDPO) 2025 establishes several core principles for the handling of personal data and grants specific rights to individuals (data subjects). Organizations are expected to cultivate a culture of accountability in personal data management to minimize data breach risks . The PDPO aims to ensure that personal data shared with organizations is accurate, used only for its intended purpose, and that consent can be freely granted or revoked . Key data subject rights under the PDPO, as outlined in the Public Consultation Paper, include the **right to withdraw consent, the right to request access to personal data, the right to request correction of errors or omissions in personal data, and the right to data portability** (though the latter was excluded from the final draft due to concerns about regulatory burden) , . These rights are not absolute and will be subject to exceptions within the PDPO. The "Access Obligation" requires organizations to provide individuals with their personal data and information about how it has been used or disclosed within a year before the request, subject to exceptions . The PDPO also mandates that organizations make reasonable efforts to ensure personal data is accurate and complete if it's likely to be used to make decisions affecting the individual or disclosed to another organization . Furthermore, a "Protection Obligation" requires organizations to implement reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks .



**Consent is a fundamental aspect of the Personal Data Protection Order (PDPO) 2025**. Individuals must be informed about the purposes of data collection and have the ability to opt-in or opt-out, as well as the right to withdraw their consent at any time , . The PDPO framework emphasizes that consent must be freely given, and organizations are prohibited from preventing an individual from withdrawing consent . When an individual withdraws consent, the organization is required to inform them of the likely consequences of this action. Following the withdrawal, the organization must cease all collection, use, and disclosure of the personal data for the purposes to which the consent applied, and ensure its data intermediaries and agents do the same . This applies to both express and deemed consent. The framework also requires organizations to notify individuals if their personal data is to be used for a new purpose not previously communicated, which would typically require fresh consent . For minors (individuals under 18), consent from a parent or legal guardian is required if the minor is unable to provide it themselves .



The Personal Data Protection Order (PDPO) 2025 in Brunei Darussalam includes provisions regarding the transfer of personal data outside the country. It is anticipated that under the PDPO, an organization shall not transfer personal data to a country outside Brunei Darussalam except in accordance with prescribed requirements to ensure that the transferred personal data receives a standard of protection comparable to that under the PDPO , . The Public Consultation Paper indicated that organizations must not transfer personal data to a country or territory outside Brunei Darussalam except in accordance with requirements prescribed under the PDPO to ensure comparable protection . AITI has stated its intention to provide guidance on specific cross-border transfer mechanisms permitted under the PDPO at a later date and recommends the adoption of the ASEAN Model Contractual Clauses for Cross Border Data Flows (MCCs) , . However, it is anticipated that these MCCs might require significant modification for practical use , . The US-ASEAN Business Council suggested that transfers should be permitted where the data controller takes reasonable steps to ensure continued protection, such as assessing comparable obligations in the recipient country, binding corporate rules, codes of conduct, contractual terms, or adherence to international standards or certifications , . While specific data localization requirements (i.e., mandating data to be stored within Brunei) are not explicitly detailed in the available information, one source from 2020 suggested that Negara Brunei Darussalam demands strict data localization , though this may refer to previous understandings or sector-specific rules.



The Personal Data Protection Order (PDPO) 2025 in Brunei Darussalam establishes penalties for non-compliance. The Authority (AITI) can impose a financial penalty if an organization intentionally or negligently contravenes provisions of Part 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 of the Order . The financial penalty cannot exceed:

* 10% of the organization's annual turnover in Brunei Darussalam if it exceeds BND 10,000,000, or

* BND 1,000,000 in any other case , .

&#x20;   The annual turnover is determined from the most recent audited accounts available at the time the penalty is imposed . When determining the penalty amount, the Authority must consider factors such as the nature, gravity, and duration of non-compliance; the type of personal data affected; any financial benefit gained or loss avoided; actions taken to mitigate consequences; prior compliance measures; compliance with remedial directions; the proportionality and effectiveness of the penalty; the impact on the organization's activities; and any other relevant matter . In addition to financial penalties, the Authority has powers to issue directions, such as ordering an organization to stop collecting, using, or disclosing personal data in contravention of the PDPO, to destroy unlawfully collected data, or to provide access to or correct personal data . The Order also provides for imprisonment for certain offenses, such as unauthorized disclosure of personal data, which can result in a fine not exceeding $5,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or both , .



### 2.8. Cambodia

Cambodia's primary data protection legislation is currently in draft form. The **Draft Law on Personal Data Protection (LPDP)**, drafted by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPTC), was released for public consultation on July 25, 2023 , . As of early 2025, this draft law had not yet been enacted, and Cambodia remained one of the few ASEAN countries without a comprehensive data privacy law , . The LPDP is intended to establish comprehensive requirements for the processing of personal data, introducing modern data protection standards and enforcement mechanisms . It is expected to align with international frameworks such as the GDPR, HIPAA, PIPEDA, and PIPL . Until the LPDP is enacted, data protection in Cambodia is addressed through various sector-specific laws and regulations, including the **E-Commerce Law (2019)**, **the Consumer Protection Law (2019)**, and the **Prakas on Credit Reporting (2020)** , . The existing legal framework does not have a dedicated data protection authority, and enforcement of data protection matters generally falls under the purview of various sectoral authorities like the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Interior , .



The **Draft Law on Personal Data Protection (LPDP)** in Cambodia, if enacted in its current form, would primarily apply to the **private sector**, although it may also cover some aspects of what could be considered the public sector, such as public establishments of an administrative character and public enterprises , . It explicitly states that the "collection, use, and disclosure of personal data by Public Authorities” are governed by other legal instruments . Regarding its territorial application, the draft LPDP applies to the 'collection, use, and disclosure of personal data by data controllers and data processors located in' Cambodia, regardless of whether the processing takes place outside Cambodia , . If the data controller is located *outside* Cambodia, the Law would only apply to collection and processing activities taking place *within* Cambodia's territory , . This suggests a limited extraterritorial scope, primarily focusing on activities physically conducted within Cambodia or by entities established within Cambodia. Current regulations, such as the E-Commerce Law, also have implications for applicability, as companies engaged in e-commerce with a "permanent establishment" in Cambodia are subject to Cambodian law, which could have extra-territorial effect if an offshore company is deemed to have such an establishment , .



Businesses considering operations in Cambodia must pay close attention to the evolving data protection landscape, particularly the provisions within the **Draft Law on Personal Data Protection (LPDP)** concerning data localization and cross-border data transfers . A primary consideration is the requirement for **consent**. The E-Commerce Law requires express consent for the use or storage of personal data , and the LPDP is expected to further elaborate on consent requirements . **Data localization** is a significant aspect, with **Article 24 of the draft LPDP mandating that data controllers localize all personal data in Cambodia** , . This means companies may need to store and process certain personal data within Cambodia . Furthermore, **Article 22 of the draft LPDP proposes a general prohibition on cross-border transfers of personal data** from Cambodia to other countries or territories, unless specifically authorized under the law or relevant instruments , . The Global Data Alliance has urged Cambodia to revise these restrictive measures , . Businesses should also be aware of **penalties for non-compliance**. The E-Commerce Law stipulates penalties including fines and imprisonment for failures related to consent, purpose limitation, and disclosure . The draft LPDP is expected to introduce its own set of administrative and criminal penalties , . Many details of the LPDP's implementation are expected to be outlined in subsequent "prakas" (ministerial regulations) , .



### 2.9. Laos

The primary legislation governing data protection in Laos, specifically for electronic data, is the **Law on Electronic Data Protection No. 25/NA (2017)**, supplemented by the **Instructions on the Implementation of the Law on Electronic Data Protection (2018)** , . This law aims to protect the electronic data of individuals, legal entities, and organizations from improper disclosure or use . It classifies electronic personal data into "general data" (e.g., name, position, address, phone number, email – accessible without consent if source is stated) and "specific data" (e.g., customer data, financial data, personal history, health records – restricted access, use, or dissemination without owner authorization) , . Other relevant laws include the **Penal Code (No. 62/NA, May 17, 2017)**, which criminalizes the disclosure of private confidential information obtained during professional duties if it causes damage , , and the **Decree on Consumer Protection Concerning Financial Services (Bank of Lao PDR, 2020)**, which imposes data breach notification duties on financial service providers , . The Ministry of Technology and Communications (MTC), formerly the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPTC), is the key regulator , . A draft Decree on Digital Transformation, discussed in May 2025, highlighted the need to review and update the existing legal framework, including the Law on Electronic Data Protection, to better support digital transformation and align with international standards like the GDPR .



The **Law on Electronic Data Protection (2017)** of Laos applies to the protection of electronic data of individuals, legal entities, and organizations , . It distinguishes between "general data" and "specific data," with the latter requiring owner authorization for access, use, or dissemination , . The law's applicability extends to any person or entity handling such electronic data within Laos. While the law itself doesn't explicitly detail its extraterritorial application in the provided snippets, the general principle is that laws apply within the territory of enactment. However, the Law on Electronic Data Protection itself emphasizes that any individual, legal entity, or organization contemplating sending or transferring personal data or official data out of Laos must obtain the consent of the Information Owner and ensure such transfer does not contravene Lao laws , . The **Law on Information and Communication Technology in Lao PDR is noted to prohibit the cross-border transfer of non-personal data held by governmental agencies for security reasons, with no exceptions** , . The Penal Code provisions regarding disclosure of private confidential information would apply to individuals who come into possession of such information during their profession or duties, regardless of the specific medium, if the disclosure causes damage , .



Businesses operating in Laos, including a Chinese robotic company, need to consider several aspects of the local data protection framework. Firstly, the **distinction between "general data" and "specific data"** under the Law on Electronic Data Protection is paramount , . Most business-related personal data will likely be classified as "specific data," meaning its collection, use, or dissemination requires the **authorization of the individual concerned** , . Employers, for example, are prohibited from disclosing an employee's specific personal data without authorization , . Secondly, **consent and notification requirements** are present, particularly for electronic marketing, which is regulated by the Decision on Protection of Consumers Using Telecommunications and Internet Services (2020) . Thirdly, regarding **data breaches and security**, the Law on Electronic Data Protection itself does not specify sanctions for breach notification obligations generally , . However, the Decree on Consumer Protection Concerning Financial Services (2020) mandates that financial service providers record data breach incidents and immediately notify affected customers and the Bank of Lao PDR for significant breaches , . Fourthly, **cross-border data transfers** are not extensively regulated under the primary E-Data Protection Law for private entities, but the government's cautious approach to data leaving the country, especially for government data, suggests a need for caution , . Finally, **penalties for non-compliance** can arise from various laws, including the Penal Code (imprisonment and fines for unauthorized disclosure of private confidential information) ,  and the E-Data Protection Law (fines ranging from 5 million to 50 million Lao Kip, approx. USD 250-2,500) , .



### 2.10. Myanmar

Myanmar's data protection regulatory framework is currently characterized by a **lack of a comprehensive, specific data protection law** , . The primary legislation addressing privacy is the **Law Protecting the Privacy and Security of Citizens (2017)**, often referred to as the "Privacy Law" , . However, this law has significant limitations, primarily applying only to Myanmar citizens and offering protections against specific government actions rather than establishing broad data protection principles for commercial entities , . A significant recent development is the **Myanmar Cybersecurity Law (No. 1/2025)**, enacted on January 1, 2025, which introduces stringent measures for data protection, digital surveillance, and online regulation , . Other relevant laws include the **Electronic Transactions Law (2004, as amended up to 2021)**, the **Telecommunications Law (2013, as amended)**, the **Financial Institutions Law (2016)**, and the **Competition Law (2015)**, each containing provisions related to confidentiality or data handling in specific contexts , . The Constitution of Myanmar (2008) also recognizes the right to personal privacy and security , .



The applicability of Myanmar's data protection-related laws varies. The **Law Protecting the Privacy and Security of Citizens (2017)** primarily applies to actions within Myanmar and does not appear to have broad extraterritorial effect . However, the new **Myanmar Cybersecurity Law (No. 1/2025)** contains an important provision regarding **extraterritorial penalties**. This law authorizes penalties against Myanmar citizens who are found guilty of violations, even if these violations occur outside the country's borders , . The Cybersecurity Law also applies to digital platform providers and cybersecurity service providers operating in Myanmar, requiring them to obtain licenses , . The **Electronic Transactions Law (2004)** applies to data controllers and processors in Myanmar . The **Telecommunications Law (2013)** governs entities holding telecommunications licenses in Myanmar . Cross-border data transfers are not expressly restricted under Myanmar’s general laws, and there is no specific statutory provision for the transfer of data overseas, though the Telecommunications Law may impose restrictions through license conditions . The Electronic Transactions Law suggests that personal data may be transferred overseas with the consent of the data subject .



For a Chinese robotic company considering operations in Myanmar, the data protection and cybersecurity landscape presents several critical considerations. Firstly, the **Myanmar Cybersecurity Law (No. 1/2025)** introduces stringent new obligations. A major concern is **data retention**: service providers must store user data for up to three years, and government authorities can request access to this data without a court order , . Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, including fines and business restrictions . This has significant implications for data management practices and infrastructure. Secondly, **government surveillance and access to data** are key features of the current legal environment, with the Cybersecurity Law granting extensive powers to authorities , . Businesses relying on cloud-based services hosted outside Myanmar may face accessibility issues or be forced to localize data storage to comply. Thirdly, the **licensing requirements for digital platform providers and cybersecurity service providers** under the Cybersecurity Law must be carefully assessed , . Fourthly, while general data protection principles are scattered, existing laws like the Electronic Transactions Law and Telecommunications Law impose certain confidentiality and data handling obligations , . Finally, the **political and legal instability** in Myanmar creates an environment of uncertainty, making it crucial to obtain up-to-date legal advice and proceed with extreme caution regarding data handling and compliance. The overall framework is still developing, and businesses face uncertainty due to the fragmented nature of regulations and the limited scope of existing laws.



## 3. Comparative Analysis of Key Provisions

### 3.1. Data Localization Requirements Across the Region

Data localization requirements in Southeast Asia present a varied landscape, with some countries imposing strict mandates and others adopting a more flexible approach. **Vietnam stands out with its stringent data localization rules under the Law on Cybersecurity**, requiring certain service providers to store user data locally and establish a local presence . **Indonesia also has sector-specific localization requirements**, particularly in the financial sector, and its PDP Law mandates local storage for critical personal data , . **Cambodia's draft LPDP indicates a strong move towards data localization**, with provisions that could require all locally collected personal data to be stored within its borders , . Similarly, **Laos has introduced data localization for government-held non-personal data and shows a cautious stance on cross-border data flows**, which may extend to personal data , . In contrast, countries like **Singapore generally oppose broad data localization mandates**, focusing instead on ensuring adequate protection for data transferred internationally . **Malaysia and Thailand also do not impose general data localization requirements**, but they regulate cross-border data transfers to ensure comparable levels of protection , . **Brunei's PDPO 2025 does not explicitly mandate general localization but places strong conditions on cross-border transfers** to ensure comparable protection , . The Philippines generally does not require localization but mandates comparable protection for cross-border transfers. Myanmar's new Cybersecurity Law, with its data retention requirements and government access provisions, could effectively lead to de facto localization for certain data. This patchwork of regulations necessitates careful planning for Chinese robotic companies regarding where and how data is stored and processed.



### 3.2. Consent Mechanisms and Stringency

Consent is a foundational element of data protection laws across Southeast Asia, generally requiring it to be **freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous**. However, the stringency and specific requirements for obtaining valid consent can vary. Most countries, including **Indonesia (PDP Law)**, **Malaysia (PDPA)**, **Thailand (PDPA)**, **Vietnam (PDPD)**, **the Philippines (DPA)**, **Singapore (PDPA)**, and **Brunei (PDPO 2025)**, mandate explicit consent for the processing of sensitive personal data , . For general personal data, while consent is a primary lawful basis, these laws also recognize alternative legal bases for processing, such as contractual necessity, legal obligations, vital interests, and legitimate interests, similar to the GDPR. The definition of "sensitive personal data" itself can differ slightly between jurisdictions, though it commonly includes health data, biometric data, genetic data, and information about religious or political beliefs. **Malaysia's PDPA**, for example, requires data users to inform individuals about the purpose of data collection and obtain consent before sharing it, with specific rules for sensitive personal information . **Vietnam's PDPD emphasizes explicit consent and provides data subjects with rights to access and review their personal data** , . **Indonesia's PDP Law requires clear, informed, specific, and voluntary consent**, and parental consent for minors under 18 , . **Brunei's PDPO 2025 mandates consent for data handling and emphasizes the right to withdraw consent** , . The practical implementation of consent mechanisms, such as the use of pre-ticked boxes (generally not accepted) and the ease of withdrawing consent, are critical considerations for compliance. The level of detail required in privacy notices to ensure informed consent also varies.



### 3.3. Variances in Penalties and Enforcement Practices

Penalties for non-compliance with data privacy laws in Southeast Asia can be severe, encompassing **administrative fines, criminal sanctions (including imprisonment), and civil liabilities**. However, the magnitude of these penalties and the rigor of enforcement practices differ significantly across the region. **Indonesia's PDP Law** stipulates administrative fines of up to **2% of annual revenue** and criminal penalties including imprisonment for responsible individuals , . **Malaysia's PDPA**, as amended, can impose fines up to **MYR 1 million** and imprisonment for breaches of data protection principles, and fines up to MYR 250,000 for failure to notify data breaches , . **Thailand's PDPA** allows for administrative fines up to **5 million Baht** and criminal penalties including imprisonment . **Singapore's PDPA** was amended to increase financial penalties to up to **SGD 1 million** . **Vietnam's PDPD** also outlines significant penalties, including monetary fines and operational suspensions. **Brunei's PDPO 2025** establishes financial penalties of up to **BND 1 million or 10% of annual turnover** for negligent or intentional breaches , . The **Philippines' DPA** provides for imprisonment and fines up to **PHP 4 million** for unauthorized processing of sensitive personal information . While these figures indicate substantial financial risks, the actual enforcement landscape is still developing in some countries. Nations like Singapore and the Philippines have more established track records of enforcement actions by their data protection authorities (PDPC and NPC, respectively). In other jurisdictions, enforcement may be less consistent or still ramping up. The establishment of dedicated data protection authorities and their capacity to investigate and sanction non-compliance is a key factor influencing the practical risk for businesses.



### 3.4. Extraterritorial Application of Laws

A significant trend in Southeast Asian data protection laws is their **increasing extraterritorial reach**, meaning that foreign companies not physically present in a country can still be subject to its data privacy regulations if they process personal data of its residents. This is a critical consideration for Chinese robotic companies targeting customers in the region from abroad. **Indonesia's PDP Law** explicitly applies to entities outside Indonesia if their data processing activities have legal consequences within Indonesia or affect Indonesian data subjects , . **Thailand's PDPA** similarly applies to foreign entities offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, individuals in Thailand , . **Vietnam's PDPD** has a broad extraterritorial scope, applying to foreign entities processing personal data of Vietnamese data subjects, even if the processing occurs outside Vietnam , . The **Philippines' DPA** applies to foreign entities with a link to the Philippines (e.g., an office or carrying on business) processing personal data of Filipino citizens or residents . **Singapore's PDPA** applies to organizations outside Singapore if they collect, use, or disclose personal data of individuals in Singapore while having an office or place of business in Singapore or while physically present in Singapore for such activities . **Malaysia's PDPA** applies to data users not established in Malaysia if they use equipment in Malaysia for processing personal data (other than for transit) . **Brunei's PDPO 2025** is intended to apply to overseas organizations processing personal data in Brunei , . **Cambodia's draft LPDP** would apply to foreign data controllers if their processing activities occur within Cambodian territory , . This widespread extraterritoriality necessitates a global compliance strategy for any company handling personal data connected to Southeast Asian residents.



## 4. Practical Implications for Chinese Robotic Companies

### 4.1. Steps for Ensuring Compliance in Target Markets

Ensuring compliance with diverse data privacy laws across Southeast Asia requires a proactive and systematic approach for Chinese robotic companies. The first crucial step is to **conduct thorough due diligence and mapping of data processing activities** in each target market. This involves identifying what personal data is collected (e.g., from users, employees, third parties), the purposes of processing, data flows (including cross-border transfers), and the legal bases for processing. Secondly, companies must **develop and implement comprehensive data protection policies and procedures** tailored to the specific requirements of each country's laws. These policies should cover data collection, consent management, data subject rights, data security, data breach response, and data retention and disposal. Thirdly, **appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO)** may be necessary or advisable, as mandated by laws in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia (under certain circumstances), Thailand, and the Philippines. Even where not strictly mandatory, a DPO or a dedicated privacy team can oversee compliance efforts. Fourthly, **implementing robust technical and organizational security measures** is essential to protect personal data from breaches, in line with the security obligations in all regional data protection laws. This includes encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments. Fifthly, **establishing clear procedures for handling data subject requests** (e.g., access, correction, erasure) and data breach notifications is critical. Finally, **ongoing training for employees** on data protection principles and company policies, and **regular audits and reviews** of compliance programs, will help maintain a strong culture of data privacy and adapt to evolving regulations.



### 4.2. Impact of Data Privacy Laws on Product Design and Data Handling

Data privacy laws in Southeast Asia have a profound impact on the **design of robotic products and the handling of data** they generate or interact with. The principle of **Privacy by Design and by Default** is increasingly relevant, requiring companies to integrate data protection considerations into the very architecture of their products and services from the outset. This means minimizing data collection to what is strictly necessary for the intended purpose (data minimization), implementing strong security features, and ensuring transparency about data processing. For robotic products, which may collect sensitive data like biometric information (e.g., facial recognition, voice patterns), location data, or behavioral data, obtaining **valid and explicit consent** is paramount. User interfaces must be designed to provide clear and concise privacy notices and easy-to-use consent mechanisms. Furthermore, robotic systems must be capable of **supporting data subject rights**, such as allowing users to access their data, request corrections, or delete their data. Data handling practices, including data storage, retention, and cross-border data transfers, must align with local regulations. For instance, if a robot collects data that falls under data localization requirements (e.g., in Vietnam or potentially Cambodia), the product's architecture may need to support local data storage solutions. The increasing scrutiny on automated decision-making and profiling also means that Chinese robotic companies need to be transparent about any such functionalities and provide users with appropriate controls or avenues for human intervention.



### 4.3. Building Trust and Mitigating Risks in Southeast Asian Markets

For Chinese robotic companies, **building trust with consumers, business partners, and regulatory authorities in Southeast Asian markets is intrinsically linked to robust data privacy compliance**. In an era of heightened awareness about data misuse, demonstrating a strong commitment to protecting personal data can be a significant competitive differentiator. Proactive compliance helps mitigate substantial risks, including **hefty financial penalties, legal sanctions, operational disruptions, and severe reputational damage** that can arise from data breaches or non-compliance with local laws. Establishing clear and transparent data handling practices, providing easily accessible privacy policies, and promptly addressing data subject requests can foster consumer confidence. Engaging with local data protection authorities, where appropriate, and seeking certifications or adhering to recognized privacy frameworks can further enhance credibility. For robotic technologies, which may sometimes evoke concerns about surveillance or unintended data collection, being transparent about data usage and implementing strong privacy safeguards is particularly crucial. By prioritizing data privacy, Chinese robotic companies can not only navigate the complex regulatory landscape but also build a foundation of trust that is essential for long-term success and acceptance in the diverse markets of Southeast Asia. This involves not just meeting the minimum legal requirements but striving for best practices in data governance.



## 5. Future Outlook and Evolving Regulations

### 5.1. Potential for Harmonization within ASEAN

While each ASEAN member state has developed its data protection laws with unique national characteristics, there is an ongoing **effort towards greater harmonization within the region**. The **ASEAN Framework on Personal Data Protection (AFDPP)**, adopted in 2016, provides a set of overarching principles intended to guide member states in developing or updating their national data protection regimes and to facilitate cross-border data flows within ASEAN. Although the AFDPP is not legally binding, it reflects a shared commitment to promoting a common understanding of data protection and fostering trust in the digital economy. Initiatives like the **ASEAN Model Contractual Clauses (MCCs)** for cross-border data transfers aim to provide a standardized mechanism for businesses to comply with data transfer requirements across different ASEAN jurisdictions , . However, achieving full harmonization is challenging due to differing legal traditions, levels of economic development, and national security priorities among member states. While some convergence around core principles is evident, significant variations in specific provisions, enforcement mechanisms, and interpretations are likely to persist. Chinese robotic companies should therefore continue to monitor both national developments and regional initiatives, as increased alignment could simplify compliance efforts in the long term, but a country-by-country approach will remain essential for the foreseeable future.



### 5.2. Emerging Trends in Data Governance and Privacy

Several emerging trends in data governance and privacy are shaping the regulatory landscape in Southeast Asia, which Chinese robotic companies should closely monitor. **Increased enforcement and higher penalties** are becoming more common as data protection authorities gain experience and resources. This means that non-compliance is becoming riskier and more costly. There is also a growing focus on **regulating new technologies**, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and biometrics, which are often integral to robotic systems. Laws are being adapted or newly introduced to address the specific privacy challenges posed by these technologies, including issues of algorithmic bias, transparency, and data security. **Data localization and sovereignty** remain key concerns for many governments in the region, leading to stricter rules on cross-border data transfers and data storage, as seen in Vietnam and potentially Cambodia. Furthermore, there is an increasing emphasis on **accountability and demonstrating compliance**, with requirements for Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), mandatory data breach notifications, and the appointment of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) becoming more prevalent. Finally, consumer awareness and expectations regarding data privacy are rising, putting pressure on companies to adopt ethical data practices and be more transparent about how they collect, use, and protect personal data. These trends indicate that data governance will continue to be a critical area of focus for businesses operating in Southeast Asia.
