*Table 1: Comparison of User Description and "Princess Arete" Plot Elements*



### 1.1 Princess's Confinement and Desire for Freedom

The film **"Princess Arete" prominently features the titular character, Princess Arete, who is confined to a high tower by her father, the King** . This seclusion is a result of her growing importance in the kingdom and her father's desire to marry her off to a suitable suitor, effectively keeping her in a privileged yet isolated environment . From her tower, Arete can only observe the vibrant life of the town below, fueling her curiosity and desire to experience the world beyond her isolated existence . She dreams of traveling and exploring, a longing symbolized by a book about the world that she keeps hidden under her bed . This confinement and her subsequent actions to escape it, such as sneaking out of the tower to visit the town and marvel at the crafts and handiwork of the townspeople, are central to her character arc and the film's narrative . The film portrays her as a young woman filled with a great interest in life, yet expected to live a mundane existence, highlighting the conflict between her personal desires and her royal obligations . Her repeated attempts to escape, even after being caught, underscore her strong will and determination to break free from the constraints placed upon her .



### 1.2 Suitors and Magical Gifts

In **"Princess Arete," the King organizes a competition for Arete's hand in marriage, requiring suitors to undertake quests for magical objects created by an ancient race** . These knights and princes compete daily, bringing their findings to impress the King and win the princess's hand . The film introduces several suitors, including Dullabore, a braggart who attempts to impress Arete with tales of his exploits, and a Blond Knight who tries to deceive her with a stolen rose . Princess Arete, however, **sees through their posturing and dishonesty, showing no interest in them** . This element of suitors bringing magical gifts aligns with the user's recollection. The film emphasizes that these quests, while framed as heroic deeds, often involve morally questionable actions such as stealing and slaughtering innocents to obtain the desired magical items, a practice Arete scolds them for . This critical view of the suitors' actions and the nature of their "gifts" adds a layer of complexity to the traditional fairy tale trope.



### 1.3 The Wizard Boax's Intervention

A pivotal character in **"Princess Arete" is the wizard Boax, who arrives at the castle in a flying machine, claiming the hand of the princess** . Boax does not genuinely love Arete; his intention is to kidnap her due to a prophecy foretelling that she has the power to take away his eternal life, or, as some interpretations suggest, he seeks an eternal companion, having grown weary of his created servants . To achieve his goal, **Boax uses magic to change Arete's appearance to that of a more "traditional" princess and enchants her into expressing a desire to marry him** . This manipulation persuades the King to allow Boax to take Arete away . Boax then imprisons her in his dungeon in his far-away castle, revealing his true intentions . This sequence of events, where a wizard arrives, enchants the princess, and takes her away to imprison her, closely matches the user's description. The character of Boax is central to the conflict, representing a powerful, manipulative force that the princess must overcome.



### 1.4 The Magic Ring and Wishes

A significant plot element in **"Princess Arete"&#x20;**&#x69;s the magical, wish-granting ring given to Arete by a witch she meets in a secret corridor of the castle, just before she is taken to Boax's castle . This ring is said to be able to **grant three wishes** . Crucially, the user's memory of the princess wasting the first two wishes on trivial things like cloth or a bed is reflected in the film. Reviews and plot summaries indicate that at her new, imprisoned home in Boax's castle, Arete initially uses her wishes for seemingly insignificant comforts, such as a comfortable bed and food, not fully grasping the ring's potential or her dire situation, possibly due to Boax's enchantments . The ring, therefore, represents a potential tool for Arete to overcome her predicament, and its three-wish nature is a common trope in fairy tales that the film incorporates. The exact manner in which Arete utilizes these wishes to aid her escape or outwit the wizard is a key detail that further solidifies the match.



### 1.5 Imprisonment and Escape

Following her betrothal to the wizard Boax, **Princess Arete is taken to his distant castle and imprisoned in a dungeon** . This imprisonment is not just physical but also psychological, as Boax has enchanted her to appear as a traditional, compliant princess . While in the dungeon, Arete befriends Ample, a villager who brings food to Boax in exchange for magical water for her town . Encouraged by Ample, Arete eventually breaks Boax's enchantment and regains her spirit . Later, Boax, still believing her to be enchanted, releases her from the dungeon and sends her on a quest to retrieve a ruby from a golden eagle . Instead of completing this quest, **Arete returns to Boax's castle in secret and discovers the source of his magical water supply** . This act of defiance and her subsequent actions, which lead to Boax destroying his own castle in a fit of despondency and losing his eternal life, constitute her escape and triumph over the wizard . The user's recollection of the princess escaping and tricking the wizard aligns with this general narrative arc.



### 1.6 Transformation (Frog/Human)

The film **"Princess Arete" includes a character named Grovel, who is Boax's servant and was once a frog however he was changed into a human-like character through Boax's magic** . This element of a character being transformed from a frog into a humanoid state by the wizard directly matches the user's recollection of "something to do with people being turned into frogs." Grovel is depicted as constantly fearful of being turned back into a frog, adding a layer of anxiety and servitude to his character . Furthermore, Boax is also described as having the power to transfigure humans into animals, specifically frogs . While the summaries do not indicate that the princess herself is turned into a frog, or that multiple people undergo this specific transformation, the presence of this type of magical transformation linked to the wizard Boax is a significant point of similarity. This detail is less common in fairy tale narratives than, for example, a prince being turned into a frog, making its inclusion in "Princess Arete" particularly noteworthy.



## 2. Elements from User Description Partially Matching or Requiring Clarification

### 2.1 Princess Accusing a Prince of Stealing an Orb

The user's description includes a specific scene where several princes bring gifts, and the princess discovers that one prince battled natives to obtain an "orb thing" as a gift. She then accuses him of being a thief for stealing their relic . The available summaries of "Princess Arete" mention that knights compete for her hand by questing for magical objects created by an ancient race, and that she meets suitors who bring gifts or attempt to impress her . One suitor, the Blond Knight, attempts to fool her with a rose he has stolen from the castle gardens, and **Arete "calls his bluff and sends him away"** . This shows her discernment and willingness to confront dishonesty. Furthermore, Arete is depicted as scolding the princes for "stealing and slaughtering from innocents" to obtain their treasures . While the summaries do not specifically mention an "orb" as one of the gifts, nor do they describe a scene where she accuses a prince of stealing a relic from natives in the exact context provided, the general theme of suitors bringing magical items through questionable means and Arete judging their character is present. The "orb" could be one of the many "magic treasures"  sought, and her accusation of theft aligns with her established moral stance.



### 2.2 Post-Apocalyptic Setting vs. Ancient Civilization

The user describes the movie as taking place in a "sort of post apocalyptic type world, hundreds of years after a great magical civilization crumbled." The summaries of "Princess Arete" indicate that the suitors quest for **"magical objects created by an ancient race"** . This suggests a setting where a past, advanced magical civilization existed, the remnants of which are now sought-after treasures. More directly, the sorcerer **Boax is described as coming from an "ancient civilization of 'magicians' who were actually engineers of complex technologies"** . This civilization was destroyed, and Boax, who was a boy at the time, had not fully learned its technologies but managed to keep himself alive using a life-prolonging pendant . While this aligns with the "great magical civilization crumbled" aspect, the term "post-apocalyptic" often implies a more desolate or technologically regressed world, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided summaries for "Princess Arete." The film's primary setting appears to be a medieval-style kingdom. However, the "ancient race" and their powerful magical creations, along with Boax's origins, strongly suggest a significant cataclysmic event or decline, fitting the user's core concept of a world shaped by a crumbled magical past.



### 2.3 Rock that Creates Water

The user mentions a scene where the princess "finds a rock that creates water." In "Princess Arete," there is a significant plot point related to water and its magical creation. **Boax magically supplies water to a nearby village in exchange for food** . Arete, after being sent on a quest by Boax and returning in secret, **"discovers the source of Boax's magical ability to create water for the town"** . While the summaries do not explicitly state that this source is a "rock," the discovery of the magical means by which Boax provides water is a key event. It is plausible that this source could be a magical artifact, potentially a rock or gem, given the fantasy context. Later, Boax, in a fit of despondency, "destroys his own castle and releases water into the land," and it is revealed he is not a great wizard and could only use limited power learned as a child before his people were wiped out . This suggests the water magic was tied to his power or an artifact he controlled. The user's memory of a "rock that creates water" could be a simplification or a specific interpretation of this magical water source that Arete discovers.



## 3. Key Differentiators from Other Potential Films

### 3.1 Specificity of Wizard's Name (Boax)

The film **"Princess Arete" specifically identifies the wizard character as Boax** . This is a concrete detail that, if remembered by the user, would strongly point towards this film. Many animated films feature generic "wizards" or "sorcerers" without unique names, or with names that are less distinctive. The name "Boax" is relatively uncommon and specific to this particular story, derived from Diana Coles's original book "The Clever Princess" . The character of Boax is central to the plot: he arrives in a flying machine, claims Princess Arete, enchants her, imprisons her, and is ultimately defeated by her . His motivations are also clearly defined – he fears a prophecy that Arete will end his eternal life, or seeks companionship due to his own tragic backstory . This level of character detail, including a specific name and a clear, plot-relevant motivation, distinguishes "Princess Arete" from more generic fairy tale adaptations.



### 3.2 Unique Combination of Tower, Wishes, and Frog Transformation

The **combination of a princess confined to a tower, the presence of a magical ring granting three wishes (with initial wishes squandered on trivialities), and a character transformed from a frog into a human-like state by the wizard presents a relatively unique set of narrative elements that are all found in "Princess Arete"** . While individual elements like a princess in a tower (Rapunzel) or a three-wish ring (common fairy tale trope) or frog transformations (The Frog Prince) are common, their specific combination in one narrative is less so. "Princess Arete" integrates these features: Arete lives in a high tower , she receives a magical, wish-granting ring explicitlystatedtograntthreewishesinonesource and initially uses them for mundane items like a comfortable bed , and Boax's servant Grovel was once a frog transformed by Boax's magic . This particular constellation of plot points aligns well with the user's multifaceted description and serves as a strong differentiator.



## 4. Conclusion: "Princess Arete" as the Most Likely Candidate

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the user's detailed description and the information gathered, **"Princess Arete" (2001), a Japanese animated film based on Diana Coles' "The Clever Princess," emerges as the most likely candidate for the movie the user is trying to recall** . The film aligns with the core elements of the user's memory: a princess confined to a tower who sneaks out ; suitors bringing magical gifts, with the princess being critical of their methods ; a powerful wizard, Boax, who enchants and marries the princess, then imprisons her ; a magic ring granting three wishes, with initial wishes being wasted on trivial items ; the princess's eventual escape and outwitting of the wizard ; the presence of frog transformation, specifically a frog turned into a human servant ; and a setting that hints at an ancient, possibly post-apocalyptic magical civilization . While some details, such as the explicit mention of an "orb" being stolen or the "rock that creates water" in those exact terms, are not as directly confirmed, the thematic and plot-related elements surrounding these points (theft of ancient relics, control over a water source) are present . The **unique combination of these specific fantasy tropes, particularly the three-wish ring mechanics and the frog transformation, strongly supports the identification of "Princess Arete."** Therefore, it is highly probable that "Princess Arete" is the long-sought movie.
