As of 2025, major international guidelines recommend annual low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for high-risk individuals, **primarily defined** as current or former heavy smokers aged 50-80 with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history, often with a stipulation of having quit within the last 15 years. However, there is a **strong consensus against routine LDCT screening for never-smokers or low-risk populations** due to insufficient evidence of a net benefit outweighing potential harms. While other risk factors like family history, occupational exposures, and COPD are acknowledged, they are generally considered in conjunction with smoking history rather than as standalone criteria for widespread screening.

## 1. Screening Recommendations for High-Risk Populations (Current/Former Heavy Smokers)

### 1.1. General Criteria for High-Risk Individuals

As of 2025, the consensus among major international guidelines regarding low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer primarily targets high-risk populations, predominantly defined by a significant history of tobacco smoking. The core criteria consistently include a minimum age for initiating screening (typically 50 or 55 years), a quantifiable smoking history (usually at least 20 to 30 pack-years), and a **timeframe for smoking cessation if applicable (often within the last 15 years)** , . A "pack-year" is standardized as smoking an average of one pack of cigarettes per day for one year; thus, a 20 pack-year history could be achieved by smoking one pack daily for 20 years or two packs daily for 10 years , . Discontinuation of screening is generally recommended when an individual surpasses the upper age limit (commonly 80 years), has not smoked for over 15 years, or develops health conditions that significantly limit life expectancy or the ability/willingness to undergo curative lung surgery , . This focus on heavy smokers is rooted in evidence from large randomized controlled trials like the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the NELSON trial, which demonstrated a **significant mortality benefit from LDCT screening in similar high-risk cohorts** , . The NLST, for example, showed a **20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality** with three annual LDCT screens compared to chest radiography in individuals aged 55 to 74 with at least a 30 pack-year smoking history who were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years .



The rationale for these specific criteria is based on a balance of benefits and harms. LDCT screening has been shown to detect lung cancer at earlier, more treatable stages, thereby improving survival outcomes , . However, screening also carries potential harms, including **false-positive results leading to unnecessary invasive procedures, incidental findings, radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis** . Therefore, guidelines aim to identify a population where the benefits of early detection outweigh these potential harms. The emphasis on pack-year history and years since quitting reflects the direct correlation between cumulative tobacco exposure and lung cancer risk, as well as the gradual decline in risk after smoking cessation . Age criteria are also critical, as lung cancer incidence increases with age, and older individuals are more likely to have comorbidities that could affect the net benefit of screening . **Shared decision-making is a crucial component** before initiating screening, ensuring that individuals understand both the potential benefits and the possible downsides of LDCT screening , . This conversation should also include counseling on smoking cessation for current smokers, as quitting smoking remains the most effective way to reduce lung cancer risk , .



### 1.2. Specific Guidelines from Major Organizations (USPSTF, ACS, NCCN, IASLC, CHEST)

Major international organizations have issued guidelines for lung cancer screening using LDCT, with significant alignment on core eligibility criteria for high-risk individuals, though some variations exist in age ranges, pack-year requirements, and consideration of additional risk factors. The **United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **annual LDCT screening for adults aged 50 to 80 years** who have a **20 pack-year smoking history** and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should cease once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to undergo curative lung surgery. This is a Grade B recommendation, indicating moderate certainty of a moderate net benefit , . This 2021 update expanded the eligible population compared to its 2013 recommendation (which was ages 55-80, 30 pack-years) .



The American Cancer Society (ACS), in its 2023 guideline update, also recommends annual LDCT screening for individuals aged 50 to 80 years with a 20+ pack-year smoking history, who currently smoke or previously smoked , . Similar to USPSTF, screening should stop if a person develops a health problem that significantly limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to receive curative treatment , . The ACS emphasizes shared decision-making and smoking cessation counseling . The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), in its 2024 guidelines (with insights for Version 1.2025), recommends **annual LDCT for individuals aged 50 years or older with a ≥20 pack-year smoking history or a ≥20-year history of smoking cigarettes (Category 1 recommendation)** , . NCCN also includes a broader range of additional risk factors that might prompt screening discussions, such as radon exposure, occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, silica, cadmium, arsenic, beryllium, chromium, diesel fumes, nickel, coal smoke, soot), personal history of cancer (lung, lymphoma, head and neck, or smoking-related cancers), family history of lung cancer, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis, and prior radiation therapy to the chest , . The NCCN acknowledges uncertainty about the optimal duration of screening and the age for discontinuation .



The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), in its 2021 guidelines, aligns with an age range of **50-80 years and a 20+ pack-year smoking history** for individuals who have quit within the past 15 years . CHEST also considers additional risk factors like radon or occupational exposures, personal history of cancer, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis, and family history of lung cancer . The **International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)** has been active in promoting and refining lung cancer screening globally. While not always providing distinct numerical criteria, IASLC supports evidence-based screening and has contributed to consensus statements and quality indicator development , . For example, a 2023 IASLC roadmap discusses future perspectives, including the need for research on screening individuals not meeting current eligibility criteria, particularly never-smokers in certain East Asian populations where lung cancer incidence in this group is rising , . The IASLC also emphasizes the importance of robust program implementation, including smoking cessation services and multidisciplinary teams , .

*Table 1: Comparison of LDCT Screening Guidelines for High-Risk Populations (as of 2025)*



These guidelines generally reflect a consensus that annual LDCT screening offers a net benefit for a defined high-risk population primarily characterized by age and smoking history. The expansion of eligibility criteria by USPSTF and ACS in recent updates (e.g., lowering the age to 50 and pack-years to 20) aims to include more individuals who could benefit, particularly women and Black individuals who may develop lung cancer with less smoking exposure , . However, challenges remain in implementation, including low uptake rates even among eligible populations, and the need for robust infrastructure to manage screening programs effectively, including smoking cessation support and appropriate management of detected nodules , .



## 2. Screening Recommendations for Never-Smokers or Low-Risk Populations

### 2.1. Lack of Evidence for Routine Screening

As of 2025, there is a **general consensus among major international guidelines that routine low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer is not recommended for individuals who have never smoked or who are considered at low risk** based on minimal or no smoking history , . This stance is primarily due to the lack of robust evidence demonstrating a favorable balance of benefits over harms in these populations. The landmark trials that established the efficacy of LDCT screening, such as the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the NELSON trial, specifically enrolled heavy current or former smokers, making their findings less generalizable to never-smokers or light smokers , . The potential harms of screening, including false-positive results leading to unnecessary invasive procedures, radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis, become more significant when the pre-test probability of lung cancer is low , . For instance, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care explicitly recommends not screening all other adults, regardless of age, smoking history, or other risk factors, for lung cancer with LDCT, giving this a strong recommendation based on very low-quality evidence for populations outside their defined high-risk group . Similarly, guidelines from Singapore explicitly state that **screening should not be offered to non-smokers** .



The USPSTF and ACS guidelines, while expanding eligibility for high-risk smokers, **do not extend recommendations to never-smokers** , . The focus remains on populations with a substantial smoking history, as this is the most significant risk factor for lung cancer. While it is recognized that lung cancer can occur in never-smokers, and in some regions like East Asia, the proportion of lung cancers in never-smokers, particularly women, is notable , , the overall incidence in never-smoker populations in many Western countries is still relatively low, making population-based screening less cost-effective and potentially leading to a higher rate of harms per life saved. A Cochrane review, while acknowledging the mortality reduction with LDCT in high-risk populations, also highlighted the need for more research on the relative harms and benefits of CT screening across a range of different risk groups and settings, implying that current evidence is insufficient for broader recommendations . Studies exploring LDCT in non-risk-based populations, such as one in Guangzhou, China, have shown that while lung cancer can be detected, concerns about overdiagnosis and the necessity of identifying more specific high-risk factors or biomarkers for these groups persist , . For example, the Guangzhou study reported a lung cancer detection rate of 1.7% in a non-risk-based adult population (40-74 years), with 82.5% of detected cases being Stage I, but also noted a 25.5% biopsy complication rate and potential overdiagnosis concerns , .



### 2.2. IASLC Stance on Insufficient Evidence

The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) acknowledges the rising incidence of lung cancer among never-smokers in certain populations and the limitations of current screening guidelines, which predominantly focus on individuals with a significant smoking history , . While not issuing specific screening recommendations for never-smokers due to insufficient evidence, the IASLC highlights the need for further research in this area. A 2023 IASLC roadmap paper pointed out that in some East Asian settings, the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma has been increasing despite declining smoking rates, with a significant proportion of lung cancer patients, particularly women, having never smoked (e.g., up to 94% in Taiwanese women with lung cancer) . This underscores the importance of understanding lung cancer etiology and risk factors beyond tobacco smoke in these populations. The IASLC notes that research is underway, such as the TALENT trial in Taiwan, which recruited never-smokers with risk factors like family history, secondhand smoke exposure, chronic lung diseases, and certain environmental exposures. The first round of the TALENT trial showed a 2.1% detection rate of stage I or higher lung cancer, higher than in NLST and NELSON, with 17.9% having multiple primary lung cancers . This suggests that specific high-risk cohorts among never-smokers might benefit from screening, but more data, particularly on mortality reduction, is needed.



The IASLC's position reflects a call for **more nuanced risk assessment tools that can identify high-risk never-smokers** who might benefit from LDCT screening, rather than a blanket recommendation for or against screening in this diverse group. The organization emphasizes that further research is crucial to confirm that screening among never-smoking populations confers a similar benefit in terms of reducing lung cancer mortality as has been established for individuals with a heavy smoking history . The IASLC's 2025 Asia Conference on Lung Cancer also plans to focus on expanding early detection through LDCT and AI, and advancing biomarker testing, which could be particularly relevant for identifying at-risk never-smokers . Until such research provides clearer evidence, the consensus, supported by IASLC's acknowledgment of knowledge gaps, is that routine LDCT screening for the general population of never-smokers is not warranted. The focus remains on defining specific risk factors and validating screening strategies for distinct subgroups within the never-smoker population.



### 2.3. Ongoing Research and Emerging Risk Assessment Tools

While routine LDCT screening for never-smokers or low-risk populations is not currently recommended by major guidelines, **significant research efforts are underway to better understand lung cancer risks in these groups and to develop more precise risk assessment tools** that could potentially identify subsets who might benefit from screening , . The rising incidence of lung cancer among never-smokers, particularly in certain geographic regions and demographic groups, has spurred this research , . Studies are exploring a variety of risk factors beyond active smoking, including **secondhand smoke exposure, occupational exposures, air pollution, genetic predisposition (e.g., family history of lung cancer), pre-existing lung diseases (like COPD or tuberculosis), and hormonal factors** , . For example, the TALENT trial in Taiwan is specifically investigating LDCT screening in never-smokers with risk factors such as a family history of lung cancer, exposure to secondhand smoke, chronic lung diseases, and certain environmental exposures like a high cooking index or cooking in poorly ventilated spaces . Initial results from this trial showed a promising detection rate for early-stage lung cancer .



Emerging risk assessment tools aim to move beyond simple pack-year calculations to incorporate a wider array of risk factors. These may include **polygenic risk scores, biomarkers (such as those detectable in blood or sputum, often referred to as "liquid biopsies"), and imaging features beyond simple nodule detection** , . The goal is to create more personalized risk prediction models that can more accurately identify individuals at high risk, regardless of their smoking status. For instance, a 2025 MDPI article discusses the future of precision lung cancer screening, envisioning integrated platforms that combine LDCT, liquid biopsy, and AI to improve accuracy and reduce false positives, along with dynamic risk models using real-time, multi-source data for precise risk stratification . Such tools could help tailor screening strategies, including the frequency of screening, to individual risk profiles . However, these advanced risk assessment methods are still largely in the research and validation phase. The current consensus remains that until robust evidence from prospective trials demonstrates a clear net benefit and cost-effectiveness, and until validated risk prediction models for never-smokers are widely available, **LDCT screening should primarily be targeted at high-risk individuals as defined by current smoking-based criteria** , . The emphasis is on the necessity of prospective studies to evaluate the efficacy of CT screening and the importance of identifying high-risk factors or pre-screen enriching biomarkers in populations not traditionally considered high risk , .



## 3. Consideration of Other Risk Factors

### 3.1. Family History, Occupational Exposure, and COPD

While smoking history remains the primary criterion for lung cancer screening eligibility in most international guidelines, several organizations acknowledge the role of other risk factors, often in conjunction with smoking. These can include a **family history of lung cancer, significant occupational exposures to carcinogens, and a personal history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis** , . The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines are notable for explicitly incorporating a broader range of such risk factors. For individuals aged 50 years or older with a 20 or more pack-year history of smoking (or a 20 or more year history of smoking cigarettes), NCCN considers additional "comorbid conditions" that elevate lung cancer risk. These include exposure to radon, occupational exposures to agents like asbestos, silica, cadmium, arsenic, beryllium, chromium, diesel fumes, nickel, coal smoke, and soot. Furthermore, a personal history of other cancers (lung cancer, lymphoma, or smoking-related cancers such as head and neck cancer), a family history of lung cancer (in a first-degree relative), and a history of COPD or pulmonary fibrosis are also listed as factors that might influence screening decisions , . The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines also mention radon or occupational exposures, history of cancer, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis, and family history of lung cancer as relevant considerations .



The USPSTF, while its primary recommendation focuses on age and smoking history, also notes in its rationale that environmental exposures (beyond radon), prior radiation therapy to the chest, other (noncancer) lung diseases, and family history contribute to lung cancer risk, although these are not formalized as standalone eligibility criteria in the same way as in NCCN guidelines , . The World Health Organization (WHO) also identifies secondhand smoke, air pollution, and workplace hazards like chemicals and asbestos as risk factors to avoid for lung cancer prevention, and acknowledges LDCT as the primary screening method for high-risk individuals, implying that these factors contribute to risk assessment . The inclusion of these factors reflects a growing understanding of the multifactorial nature of lung cancer. For example, a family history of lung cancer can suggest a genetic predisposition, while occupational exposures to substances like asbestos are well-established carcinogens. COPD is not only often caused by smoking but is also an independent risk factor for lung cancer, possibly due to chronic inflammation and impaired lung clearance mechanisms. However, the **precise quantification of risk and the specific thresholds for screening eligibility based on these non-smoking risk factors, especially in the absence of a significant smoking history, are less standardized** and often require careful clinical judgment and shared decision-making within the context of established screening program criteria.



### 3.2. Role in Conjunction with Smoking History

Other risk factors such as family history, occupational exposures, and COPD are generally considered by guidelines in conjunction with a significant smoking history, rather than as standalone criteria for LDCT screening in most instances , . The rationale is that while these factors independently increase lung cancer risk, the absolute risk is often highest when they co-occur with substantial tobacco exposure. For example, the NCCN guidelines list these additional risk factors for individuals who are already in the age and smoking history criteria (≥50 years and ≥20 pack-years or ≥20 years of smoking) , . This approach aims to further refine the selection of high-risk individuals within the broader smoking population, potentially identifying those at even greater risk who would derive the most benefit from screening. The presence of these co-factors can strengthen the argument for screening in borderline cases or influence the intensity of follow-up for screen-detected nodules.



The USPSTF acknowledges these factors as contributors to overall lung cancer risk but does not integrate them as explicit expansion criteria in its primary recommendation statement, which is based on age, pack-years, and years since quitting , . However, the systematic reviews underpinning the USPSTF guidelines do consider the broader evidence on risk factors. The American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines primarily focus on age and smoking history for defining the high-risk population eligible for screening . The challenge in incorporating a wide array of other risk factors into standardized screening criteria lies in the complexity of accurately quantifying their individual and combined impact on lung cancer risk, and the potential for significantly expanding the screening pool, which has implications for cost-effectiveness and resource allocation. While risk prediction models that incorporate multiple variables, including some of these other factors, have been developed e.g.thePLCOM2012modelortheLiverpoolLungProjectmodel, their widespread adoption into national screening program criteria varies. For instance, the TALENT trial, which is investigating screening in never-smokers, specifically includes individuals with a family history of lung cancer as one of its risk criteria, highlighting its perceived importance even in the absence of personal smoking . Ultimately, the consideration of these additional risk factors often occurs within a shared decision-making process, where clinicians and patients discuss individual risk profiles beyond the basic eligibility criteria.
